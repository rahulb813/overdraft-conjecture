# OverDraft Conjecture

## Introduction

-   An SVM based ML model that's trained with a dataset with 600+ values.
-   Predicts yes/no prediction status for bank loans.

## Intuition

The use of SVM is done because the final output predicted by this model
is supposed to be a binary value which results that the loan confirmation is real or fake.

## Technologies Used

-   Python
-   sklearn
-   numpy
-   seaborn

## Dataset

A single [`dataset.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication/) dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://wwww.kaggle.com) is used

## Testing

The model is trained with 80% and tested with 20% of the [`train.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data) dataset and the accuracy of the model was 79% and 83% respectively.
